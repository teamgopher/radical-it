      </ul>

      <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>Information collected by Google Analytics may be transferred to and stored on servers located outside the United Kingdom (UK) or the European Economic Area (EEA), primarily in the United States. Google adheres to data protection frameworks like the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF) which provide safeguards for such transfers.</p>
      <p>When we transfer your personal data out of the UK/EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the UK authorities.</li>
        <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the UK authorities which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK (e.g., International Data Transfer Agreements or Addendums).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK/EEA.</p>

      <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data from contact forms or emails will be retained for as long as necessary to deal with your enquiry and for a reasonable period thereafter for record-keeping purposes, typically up to 2 years after our last interaction.</li>
        <li>Google Analytics data is subject to Google&apos;s data retention policies. We have configured our Google Analytics data retention period to 14 months. After this period, user-level and event-level data stored by Google Analytics is automatically deleted from Analytics’ servers. Aggregated data may be retained for longer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
